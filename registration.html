<!--
    This is the registration page for the contact manager.
    Should have
    1) text field for First Name (id = newFirstName)
    2) text field for Last Name (id = newLastName)
    3) text field for Login (id = newLogin)
    4) text field for password (id = newPassword)
    5) a button to register (id = registerButton)
    6) a span that shows up if username and password are already taken (id = registerResult)

    (if possible, make so login and password fields are required)
